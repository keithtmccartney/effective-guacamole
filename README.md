## Tips/Run

* Abc

## Errors Experienced

* Abc

## Notes:

* EntityFramework Core is no longer consumed from with "dotnet cli", a global installation to my environment was applied for use within the project via "dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef";
* The dependency injected here was marked as Scoped. There are 3 types of dependency injection:
>Transient — "Objects are different. One new instance is provided to every controller and every service"
>Scoped — "Objects are same through the request"
>Singleton — "Objects are the same for every request during the application lifetime"

## What's it all about?

* Let's build together a multi layer .NET Core API with the latest framework version and most used patterns
